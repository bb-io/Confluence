## Introduction

Create, collaborate, and organize all your work in one place. Confluence is a team workspace where knowledge and collaboration meet. Dynamic pages give your team a place to create, capture, and collaborate on any project or idea.

## Before setting up

You must ensure that you have a Confluence account and access to it. Our app uses OAuth 2.0 for authentication, so you don't need to provide any API keys. You will be redirected to the Confluence login page to authorize the app. Note, this app leverages the [Confluence Cloud REST API](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/confluence/rest/v1/intro/#about) to provide a streamlined experience for managing your content.

4. Click _Authorize connection_.
5. You will be redirected to the Confluence login page. Enter your credentials and authorize the app.
